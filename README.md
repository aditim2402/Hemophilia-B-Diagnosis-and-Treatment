# Hemophilia-B-Diagnosis-and-Treatment
This project focuses on classifying genetic variants related to Hemophilia B using machine
learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts the
severity of a variant based on its features. The dataset includes multiple attributes describing
genetic variations, mechanisms, and severity levels. The model achieved high accuracy through
data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using
XGBoost, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers.
